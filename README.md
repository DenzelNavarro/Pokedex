# Pokedex Project

## Description

This project is a simple Pokedex created by following a YouTube tutorial. The app allows users to search for Pokémon by name or ID and displays detailed information, such as:

- Pokémon name and ID
- Image
- Base stats (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.)
- Types
- Weight and height

The data is fetched from the PokéAPI, ensuring it remains up-to-date with the latest Pokémon information. This project helped me learn how to work with APIs and build an interactive user interface.

## Features
